description: My first blog post
---
*Iâ€™ve wanted to blog for a long time.*

Finally I have set up a blog. And hoping to write something consistently. Plan is to be a better developer and record the journey. I always have struggled with writing in the past, and this blog will be no exception, expect plenty of grammar errors, poor word choice, and other face-palm moments. But hey, I'm writing this for myself. 

This blog is just of the *new things* I am going to do over the next 6 months. A lot of time has been spent on thinking what to do and what not to do. So it's time to just do things & wait for the outcomes.

Most of my content will technical in nature. However, I do plan to write blog posts that are more mundane (book reviews, weekly digests of interesting reads and general reflections on life lessons).

Regardless of the reason you came here, thank you for the visit!
