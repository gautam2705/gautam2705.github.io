My name is Ashish Gautam & I work as a software developer at [Nagarro](https://www.nagarro.com/en) for about two years now. My day to day work here involves Java, Spring MVC, and Vue.js. But I like working with Python and Django as well.
Most of my time is spent on sleeping, writing code for work and pleasure, thinking about interesting things, and consuming various media. My favorite things to think about include logic puzzles problem-solving, mathematics, and the meaning of life in general.
I am an avid reader of crime mysteries, thrillers, and biographies.

You can check my progress on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/a_cute_developer/). I plan to solve 1000+ problems by the end of this year. 

I have a pretty sporadic online presence; you can email me, add me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gautam2705) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Gautam0596), or see some of my projects at my [GitHub](https://github.com/gautam2705).
